# CCM-Final

This is my Final Project for my Data Science Programming class at the County College of Morris. In this project, I analyze a Kaggle dataset on video game sales from 1977 to mid 2020 to answer questions about the accuracy of critic vs user reviews in predicting/reflecting a video game's commercial success.
